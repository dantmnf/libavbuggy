libavbuggyduration
==================

Generate media files with buggy duration to bypass re-encoding (for some online video sites only)

Mainly in 3 ways:
* Repeat first three video frames in specified time, may be recognized as VFR by most players (aka. 后黑)
* Repeat last audio frame in specified time
* Multiply all timestamps and make the last timestamp to specified time (aka. ~~红色有角三~~倍速)

There is nothing now. Please check it months later.
